    <p>This document defines a mechanism that enables developers to declare a network error reporting policy for a web application. A user agent can use this policy to report encountered network errors that prevented it from successfully fetching requested resources.</p>
  </section>

  <section id='sotd'>
  <p>This is a <strong>proposal</strong> and may change without any notices. Interested parties should bring discussions to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Accurately measuring performance characteristics of web applications is an important aspect in helping site developers understand how to improve their web applications. The worst case scenario is the failure to load the application, or a particular resource, due to a network error, and to address such failures the developer requires assistance from the user agent to identify when, where, and why such failures are occurring.</p>

    <p>Today, application developers do not have real-time web application availability data from their end users. For example, if the user fails to load the page due to a network error, such as a failed DNS lookup, a connection timeout, a reset connection, or other reasons, the site developer is unable to detect and address this issue. Note that these kinds of network errors cannot be detected purely server-side, since by definition the client might not have been able to successfully establish a connection with the server.</p>

    <p>Existing methods (such as synthetic monitoring) provide a partial solution by placing monitoring nodes in predetermined geographic locations, but require additional infrastructure investments, and cannot provide truly global and near real-time availability data for real end users.</p>

    <p>Network Error Logging (<dfn>NEL</dfn>) addresses this need by defining a mechanism enabling web applications to declare a reporting policy that can be used by the user agent to report network errors for a given origin. To take advantage of <a>NEL</a>, a web application opts into using <a>NEL</a> by supplying a <code>NEL</code> HTTP response header field that describes the reporting policy. Then, if the <a>NEL</a> policy is available for a given origin, the user agent logs information about requests to that origin, and attempts to deliver that information to a group of endpoints previously configured using the Reporting API [[!REPORTING]].  As the name implies, <a>NEL</a> reports are primarily used to describe <em>errors</em>. However, in order to determine <em>rates</em> of errors across different client populations, we must also know how many <em>successful</em> requests are occurring; these successful requests can also be reported via the <a>NEL</a> mechanism.</p>

    <p>For example, if the user agent fails to fetch a resource from <code>https://www.example.com</code> due to an aborted TCP connection, the user agent would queue the following report via the Reporting API:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>type</dt>
      <dd><code>"network-error"</code></dd>
      <dt>endpoint group</dt>
      <dd>the endpoint group configured by the <a>report_to</a> field</dd>
      <dt>settings</dt>
      <dd>TODO</dd>
      <dt>data</dt>
      <dd><pre class="highlight">
{
  "uri": "https://www.example.com/resource",
  "referrer": "https://referrer.com/",
  "server_ip": "123.122.121.120",
  "elapsed_time": 321,
  "sampling_fraction": 1.0,
  "type": "tcp.aborted"
}
      </pre></dd>
    </dl>

    See <a href="#network-error-reports"></a> for explanation of the
    communicated fields and format of the report, and <a href="#examples"></a>
    for more hands-on examples of NEL registration and reporting process.

    <h2>Conformance requirements</h2>
    <p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.  Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>
    <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]].</p>
    <p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("must", "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.</p>
    <p>Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on attributes, methods or objects. Such requirements are to be interpreted as requirements on the user agent.</p>
    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>

      <h2>Network error reports</h2>

      <p>
      A <dfn data-lt="network error|network error reports">network error
        report</dfn> describes whether or not the user agent encountered any
      connection or protocol error while handling a network request, thus
      preventing it from successfully completing the request-response exchange.
      This may include, but is not limited to DNS, TCP, TLS, and HTTP connection
      and protocol errors. For example, a network error is triggered when the
      user agent:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fails to resolve the DNS name</li>
        <li>Fails to establish a TCP connection</li>
        <li>Fails to establish a secure TLS tunnel</li>
        <li>Fails to fetch the resource due to a TLS protocol error</li>
        <li>Fails to fetch the resource due to a HTTP protocol error</li>
        <li>Fails to fetch the resource due to a socket timeout or error</li>
        <li>Fails to fetch the resource due to a redirect loop</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      The user agent MAY classify and report server error responses (<a>5xx
        status code</a>) as network errors. For example, a network error report
      may be triggered when a fetch fails due to proxy or gateway errors,
      service downtime, and other types of server errors.
      </p>

      <p>
      The failure to fetch a resource when the user agent is known to be offline
      (when <a>navigator.onLine</a> returns <code>false</code>) MUST NOT be
      considered to be a <a>network error</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
      Note that the above definition of "network error" is different from
      definition in [[Fetch]]. The definition of <a>network error</a> in this
      specification is a subset of [[Fetch]] definition – i.e. all of the above
      conditions would trigger a "network error" in [[Fetch]] processing, but
      conditions such as blocked requests due to mixed content, CORS failures,
      etc., would not.
      </p>

      <p>
      <a>Network error reports</a> have a <a>report type</a> of
      <code>network-error</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
      <a>Network error reports</a> are <strong>NOT</strong> <a>visible to
        <code>ReportingObserver</code>s</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
      <a>Network error reports</a> are not <a>visible to
        <code>ReportingObserver</code>s</a> because they are only intended to be
      visible to the administrator or owner of the server <em>receiving</em> the
      requests.  If they were <a>visible to <code>ReportingObserver</code>s</a>,
      then the reports would also be visible to the <em>originator</em> of the
      request.  For cross-origin requests, this could leak information about the
      server's network configuration to parties outside of its control.

        <p>The <dfn>NEL header field</dfn> is used to communicate the <dfn>NEL policy</dfn> to the user agent. The ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) syntax for the <a>NEL header field</a> is as follows:</p>

        <pre>NEL = json-field-value</pre>

        <p>The header's value is interpreted as an array of JSON objects, as defined by <a>json-field-value</a>. Each object in the array defines an <a>NEL policy</a> for the origin. The user agent MUST process the first valid policy in the array.</p>

        <p>User agents MUST ignore any unknown or invalid field(s) or value(s) that do not conform to the syntax defined in this specification. A valid <a>NEL header field</a> MUST, at a minimum, contain one object with all of the "REQUIRED" fields defined in this specification.</p>

        <p>The user agent MUST ignore the NEL header specified via a <code>meta</code> element to mitigate hijacking of error reporting via scripting attacks. The <a>NEL policy</a> MUST be delivered via the <a>NEL header field</a>.</p>

        <p class="note">The restriction on <code>meta</code> element is consistent with the [[CSP]] specification, which restricts reporting registration to HTTP header fields only for the same reasons.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>The <code>report_to</code> Field</h2>
          <p>The <dfn>report_to</dfn> field specifies the <a>endpoint group</a> to which the user agent sends reports about network errors. The <a>report_to</a> field is a REQUIRED field to register an <a>NEL policy</a>, and OPTIONAL if the intent is to remove a previous registration - see <a>max_age</a>. The value of the field MUST be a string containing the <a>endpoint group</a> to which reports will be sent.</p>

          <p class="note">To improve delivery of NEL reports, the application should set <code>report_to</code> to an endpoint group containing at least one endpoint in an alternative origin whose infrastructure is not coupled with the origin from which the resource is being fetched &mdash; otherwise network errors cannot be reported until the problem is solved, if ever &mdash; and provide multiple endpoints to provide alternatives if some endpoints are unreachable.</p>

        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>The <code>max_age</code> Field</h2>
          <p>The REQUIRED <dfn>max_age</dfn> field specifies the number of seconds, after the reception of the NEL header field, during which the user agent regards the host (from whom the policy was received) as a <a>known NEL origin</a>. The value of the field MUST be an non-negative integer.</p>

          <p>A <a>max_age</a> value of zero (i.e. <code>"max_age": 0</code>) signals the user agent to cease regarding the host as a <a>known NEL origin</a>, including the <a>include_subdomains</a> field if provided.</p>

          <p class="note">To ensure delivery of NEL reports, the application should ensure that the Reporting API is also configured with a sufficiently high <code>max_age</code>. If the Reporting policy expires, NEL reports will not be delivered, even if the NEL policy has not expired.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>The <code>include_subdomains</code> Field</h2>
          <p>The OPTIONAL <dfn>include_subdomains</dfn> field, if present and true, signals the user agent that the <a>NEL policy</a> applies not only to the <a>origin</a> that served the <a>resource representation</a>, but also to any <a>origin</a> whose <a>host</a> component is a subdomain of the <a>host</a> component of the <a>resource representation</a>’s <a>origin</a>. If present, the value of the field MUST be a boolean value.</p>

          <p class="note">To ensure delivery of NEL reports for subdomains, the application should ensure that the Reporting API is also configured with <code>include_subdomains</code> enabled. If the Reporting policy is not, and there is not a separate Reporting policy for a given subdomain, NEL reports for that subdomain will not be delivered, even if the NEL policy includes the subdomain.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The <code>success_fraction</code> field</h2>
          <p>The OPTIONAL <dfn>success_fraction</dfn> field defines the <a>sampling rate</a> that should be applied to reports about requests that do not result in a <a>network error</a>. If present, this field MUST have a value between <code>0.0</code> and <code>1.0</code>, inclusive. If this field is not present, it defaults to <code>0.0</code> — by default, the user agent will <em>not</em> collect NEL reports about successful requests unless specifically requested by the origin.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The <code>failure_fraction</code> field</h2>
          <p>The OPTIONAL <dfn>failure_fraction</dfn> field defines the <a>sampling rate</a> that should be applied to reports about requests that result in a <a>network error</a>. If present, this field MUST have a value between <code>0.0</code> and <code>1.0</code>, inclusive. If this field is not present, it defaults to <code>1.0</code> — by default, the user agent will collect NEL reports about <em>all</em> requests that result in a <a>network error</a>.</p>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Policy Storage and Maintenance</h2>

      <p>An HTTP host declares itself an <dfn>NEL origin</dfn> by issuing an <a>NEL policy</a>, which is communicated via the <a>NEL header field</a> from a <a>potentially trustworthy origin</a>. Upon error-free receipt and processing of this header by a conformant user agent, the user agent regards the host as a <dfn>known NEL origin</dfn>.</p>

      <p>The user agent MUST maintain the <a>NEL policy</a> of any given <a>NEL origin</a> separately from any NEL policies issued by any other <a data-lt="NEL origin">NEL origins</a>. Only the given <a>NEL origin</a> can update or cause deletion of its <a>NEL policy</a>. This is accomplished by sending a <a>NEL header field</a> to the user agent with new values for the policy <a data-lt="report_to">endpoint group</a>, <a data-lt="max_age">time duration</a>, and <a data-lt="include_subdomains">subdomain applicability</a>. Thus, the user agent MUST store the "freshest" <a>NEL policy</a> information on behalf of an <a>NEL origin</a>, and specifying a zero time duration MUST cause the user agent to delete the <a>NEL policy</a> (including any asserted <a>include_subdomains</a> field) for that <a>NEL origin</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Generating reports</h2>

      <p>
      When a request is made to a URL that belongs to a <a>known NEL origin</a>
      the user agent MUST use an algorithm equivalent to the following to decide
      whether to generate and upload a <a>network error report</a> for the
      request:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Determine the <dfn>active sampling rate</dfn> for this request:
          <ul>
            <li>If the request resulted in a <a>network error</a>, then the active sampling rate is the value of the <a><code>failure_fraction</code></a> field in the origin's <a>NEL policy</a>, or <code>1.0</code> if the <a>NEL policy</a> does not contain a <a><code>failure_fraction</code></a> field.</li>
            <li>If the request did <em>not</em> result in a <a>network error</a>, then the active sampling rate is the value of the <a><code>success_fraction</code></a> field in the origin's <a>NEL policy</a>, or <code>0.0</code> if the <a>NEL policy</a> does not contain a <a><code>success_fraction</code></a> field.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Decide whether or not to report on this request. Choose a random number between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. If this number is greater than or equal to the <a>active sampling rate</a> for this request, ignore the request and skip the remainder of this algorithm.</li>

        <li>Construct a <a>network error report</a> for the request.</li>

        <li>
          <p><a data-cite="!REPORTING#queue-report">Queue the report for delivery</a> via the Reporting API. [[!REPORTING]]</p>

          <dl>
            <dt>type</dt>
            <dd><code>network-error</code></dd>
            <dt>data</dt>
            <dd>the <a>body</a> of the <a>network error report</a> created above</dd>
            <dt>endpoint group</dt>
            <dd>the <a data-lt="report_to">endpoint group</a> defined by the <a>NEL policy</a> of the associated <a>NEL origin</a></dd>

          </dl>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sampling rates</h2>
      <p>A <a>NEL origin</a> that expects to serve a large volume of traffic might not be equipped to ingest NEL reports for every request made to the origin. The origin can define a <dfn>sampling rate</dfn> to limit the number of NEL reports that each user agent submits. Since successful requests should typically greatly outnumber requests that result in a <a>network error</a>, the origin can specify different sampling rates for each.</p>

      <p>The sampling rates are specified as a fraction — a number between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive — stored in the <a><code>success_fraction</code></a> and <a><code>failure_fraction</code></a> fields of the <a>NEL policy</a>. The user agent will use these fractions to probabilistically decide whether to create a <a>network error report</a> for each individual request to the <a>NEL origin</a>.</p>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <section>
        <h2>Sample Policy Definitions</h2>
        <pre class="example">
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: example.com

&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; ...
&lt; NEL: {"report_to": "network-errors", "max_age": 2592000}
        </pre>

        <p>The above <a>NEL policy</a> provided in the server response specifies that the user agent should register a new <a>NEL policy</a>, or update an existing one if one already exists, for the `example.com` <a>NEL origin</a>: the user agent should report network errors to the endpoint group "network-errors" and the policy applies for 2592000 seconds (30 days).</p>

        <p>Note that above registration will only succeed if the response is communicated from a <a>potentially trustworthy origin</a>.</p>

        <pre class="example">
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: example.com

&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; ...
&lt; NEL: {"report_to": "network-errors", "max_age": 2592000, "include_subdomains": true}
        </pre>

        <p>The above <a>NEL policy</a> provided in the server response specifies that the user agent should report network errors to the endpoint group "network-errors". Further, the policy is extended to all of the subdomains of the issuing <a>NEL origin</a> — see <a>include_subdomains</a>.</p>

        <pre class="example">
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: example.com

&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; ...
&lt; NEL: {"max_age": 0}
        </pre>

        <p>The above <a>NEL policy</a> provided in the server response contains <a>max_age</a> set to zero, which indicates that the user agent must delete the current registered <a>NEL policy</a> associated with the `example.com` <a>NEL origin</a> and all of its subdomains:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a>include_subdomains</a> is implicit when <a>max_age</a> is zero</li>
          <li><a>report_to</a> is optional when removing a previously registered policy</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Sample Network Error Reports</h2>

        <p>This section contains an example network error report the user agent might queue when a network error is encountered for a <a>known NEL origin</a>.</p>

        <pre class="example">
{
        "nel-report": [
            {
              "uri": "https://www.example.com/",
              "referrer": "http://example.com/",
              "server_ip": "123.122.121.120",
              "protocol": "h2",
              "status_code": 200,
              "elapsed_time": 823,
              "age": 0,
              "type": "http.protocol.error"
            }
          ]
        }
        </pre>

        <p>The above report indicates that the user agent attempted to navigate from "example.com" to "www.example.com" (<a>known NEL origin</a>), which successfully resolved to the "123.122.121.120" IP address. However, while the user agent received a "200" response from the server via the "h2" protocol, it encountered a protocol error in the exchange and was forced to abandon the navigation. 823 milliseconds elapsed between the start of navigation and when the user agent aborted the navigation. Finally, the user agent sent this report immediately after the network error was encountered - i.e. the report age is 0.</p>

        <pre class="example">
{
        "nel-report": [
            {
              "uri": "https://widget.com/thing.js",
              "referrer": "https://www.example.com/",
              "server_ip": "234.233.232.231",
              "protocol": "",
              "status_code": 0,
              "elapsed_time": 143,
              "age": 0,
              "type": "http.dns.name_not_resolved"
            }
          ]
        }
        </pre>

        <p>The above report indicates that the user agent attempted to fetch  "https://widget.com/thing.js", which belongs to a previously registered <a>NEL origin</a>, from "www.example.com" origin. However, the user agent was unable to resolve the DNS name and the request was aborted by the user agent after 143 milliseconds. Because "widget.com" is a known NEL origin, a network error report was logged and sent to the report URL specified by the NEL policy of that host immediately after the network error was encountered - i.e. the report age is 0.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Use cases</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Reporting of Navigation Failures</h2>

        <p>A navigation request initiated by the user (e.g. via a click on a link, direct input via the location bar, script-initiated due to user interaction, etc.) may fail due any number of connectivity reasons: DNS failure, TCP error, TLS protocol violation, and so on. These errors may be caused by network misconfiguration, transient routing issues, server downtime, malware or other attacks against the user, etc.</p>

        <p>In such cases the destination host is often left unaware of the failed navigation since, by definition, it cannot see the request reach its infrastructure and it is unable to investigate the problem. To address this, the host can register an <a>NEL policy</a> with the user agent, which specifies where reports of such failures should be delivered such that they can be investigated.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Reporting of First-party Subresource Fetch Failures</h2>

        <p>A typical application requires dozens of resources, the fetching of which is typically initiated via HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. The application requesting such resources can observe failures of most such fetches (e.g. via `onerror` callbacks), but it does not have access to the detailed network error report of why the failure has occurred - e.g. DNS failure, TCP error, TLS protocol violation, etc.</p>

        <p>To address this, the application can register relevant NEL policies with the user agent for the first-party hosts from which the subresources are being fetched. Then, if such a policy is present and a network error is encountered for a resource associated with a registered <a>NEL origin</a>, the user agent will report the detailed network error report and enable the application developers to investigate the error.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Reporting of Third-party Subresource Fetch Failures</h2>

        <p>In the case where a resource is embedded by a third party, the provider of the resource is often unable to instrument and observe the failure. For example, if `example.com` embeds a `widget.com/thing.js` resource on its site, and the user visiting `example.com` fails to fetch such resource due to a network error, the `widget.com` host is both unaware of the failure and unable to detect it.</p>

        <p>To address this, `widget.com` can register an NEL policy for its host. Then, if such policy is present and a network error is encountered while fetching a resource &mdash; regardless of whether it is being requested from a first-party or third-party origin &mdash; from the registered <a>NEL origin</a>, the user agent will report the network error and enable the provider to investigate the error.</p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p><a>NEL</a> provides network error reports that could expose new information about the user's network configuration. For example, an attacker could abuse NEL reporting to probe users network configuration. Also, similar to HSTS, HPKP, and pinned CSP policies, the stored <a>NEL policy</a> could be used as a "supercookie" by setting a distinct policy with a custom (per-user) reporting URI to act as an identififer in combination with (or instead of) HTTP cookies.</p>

      <p>To mitigate some of the above risks, NEL registration is restricted to <a>trustworthy origins</a>, and delivery of network error reports is similarly restricted to <a>trustworthy origins</a>. This disallows a transient HTTP MITM from trivially abusing NEL as a persistent tracker.</p>

      <p>In addition to above restrictions, the user agents MUST:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Clear the stored NEL policies when the user clears their browsing data (cookies, site data, history, etc).</li>
        <li>Refuse to process Set-Cookie response headers when delivering network error reports.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When deploying NEL the developer SHOULD consider privacy implications of NEL reports delivered to the specified collectors. For example, reports may contain URLs with sensitive data (e.g. "Capability URLs") that may need special precautions (see [[!CAPABILITY-URLS]]), and may require the developer to operate their own NEL collectors to prevent reporting of such URLs to third parties.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>IANA Considerations</h2>
      <p>The permanent message header field registry should be updated with the following registrations ([[RFC3864]]):</p>
