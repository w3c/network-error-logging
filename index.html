    <p>This document defines a mechanism that enables developers to declare a network error reporting policy for a web application. A user agent can use this policy to report encountered network errors that prevented it from successfully fetching requested resources.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Accurately measuring performance characteristics of web applications is an important aspect in helping site developers understand how to improve their web applications. The worst case scenario is the failure to load the application, or a particular resource, due to a network error, and to address such failures the developer requires assistance from the user agent to identify when, where, and why such failures are occurring.</p>

    <p>Today, application developers do not have real-time web application availability data from their end users. For example, if the user fails to load the page due to a network error, such as a failed DNS lookup, a connection timeout, a reset connection, or other reasons, the site developer is unable to detect and address this issue. Note that these kinds of network errors cannot be detected purely server-side, since by definition the client might not have been able to successfully establish a connection with the server.</p>

    <p>Existing methods (such as synthetic monitoring) provide a partial solution by placing monitoring nodes in predetermined geographic locations, but require additional infrastructure investments, and cannot provide truly global and near real-time availability data for real end users.</p>

    <p>Network Error Logging (NEL) addresses this need by defining a mechanism enabling web applications to declare a reporting policy that can be used by the user agent to report network errors for a given origin.  A web application opts into using NEL by supplying a <a>NEL</a> HTTP response header field that describes the desired <a>NEL policy</a>. This policy instructs the user agent to log information about requests to that origin, and to attempt to deliver that information to a group of endpoints previously configured using the Reporting API [[!REPORTING]].  As the name implies, NEL reports are primarily used to describe <em>errors</em>. However, in order to determine <em>rates</em> of errors across different client populations, we must also know how many <em>successful</em> requests are occurring; these successful requests can also be reported via the NEL mechanism.</p>

    <p>For example, if the user agent fails to fetch a resource from <code>https://www.example.com</code> due to an aborted TCP connection, the user agent would queue the following report via the Reporting API:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>type</dt>
      <dd><code>"network-error"</code></dd>
      <dt>endpoint group</dt>
      <dd>the endpoint group configured by the <a>report_to</a> field</dd>
      <dt>settings</dt>
      <dd>TODO</dd>
      <dt>data</dt>
      <dd><pre class="highlight">

    <h2>Conformance requirements</h2>
    <p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.  Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>
    <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]].</p>
    <p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("must", "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.</p>
    <p>Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on attributes, methods or objects. Such requirements are to be interpreted as requirements on the user agent.</p>
    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>

      <h2>Network requests</h2>

      <p>
      A <dfn data-lt="network requests">network request</dfn> occurs when the
      user agent must use the network to service a single <a>request</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      If the user agent can service a <a>request</a> out of a <a>local
        cache</a>, that <a>request</a> MUST NOT result in a <a>network
        request</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      If the user agent follows <a>redirects</a> as part of a <a>navigation</a>,
      there MUST be separate <a>network requests</a> for each <a>request</a> in
      the redirect chain.
      </p>

      <p>
      A <a>request</a> MUST NOT result in a <a>network request</a> if the user
      agent is known to be offline (i.e., when <a>navigator.onLine</a> returns
      <code>false</code>).
      </p>

      <p>
      A <a>request</a> MUST NOT result in a <a>network request</a> if it is
      blocked due to mixed content or CORS failures.  Any <a>CORS-preflight
        request</a> MUST result in its own <a>network request</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
      For user agents that service <a>requests</a> according to the [[FETCH]]
      standard, a <a>network request</a> corresponds to one execution of the
      <a>HTTP-network fetch</a> algorithm.
      </p>

      <p>
      Regardless of which fetch algorithm and which underlying application and
      transport protocols are used, servicing a <a>network request</a> consists
      of the following <dfn data-lt="phase">phases</dfn>:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <dfn>DNS resolution</dfn>: The user agent uses the Domain Name System
          [[RFC1034]] to resolve a domain name into an IP address of a
          <a>server</a> can that service HTTP requests to that domain.
        </li>

        <li>
          <dfn>Secure connection establishment</dfn>: The user agent opens a
          connection to the <a>server</a>, and establishes a secure channel over
          this connection.
        </li>

        <li>
          <dfn>Transmission of request and response</dfn>: Once the secure
          channel is established, the user agent can transmit the HTTP request,
          and receive the response from the <a>server</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
      The only mandatory phase is the <a>transmission of request and
        response</a>; the other phases might not be needed for every <a>network
        request</a>.  For instance, DNS results can be cached locally in the
      user agent, eliminating <a>DNS resolution</a> for future requests to the
      same domain.  Similarly, HTTP <a>persistent connections</a> allow open
      connections to be shared for multiple requests to the same <a>origin</a>.
      However, if multiple <a>phases</a> occur, they will occur in the above
      order.
      </p>

      <p class="ednote">
      We would like to move the definition of these phases into [[FETCH]] so
      that they are more reusable.
      </p>

      <p>
      A <a>network request</a> is <dfn
        data-lt="succeed|succeeded">successful</dfn> if the user agent is able
      to receive a valid HTTP response from the server.
      </p>

      <p>
      A <a>network request</a> is <dfn data-lt="fail">failed</dfn> if it is not
      <a>successful</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Network errors</h2>

      <p>
      A <dfn data-lt="network errors">network error</dfn> is the error condition
      that caused a <a>network request</a> to <a>fail</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Each <a>network error</a> has a <dfn data-lt="types">type</dfn>, which is
      a string.
      </p>

      <p>
      Each <a>network error</a> has a <dfn data-lt-nodefault
        data-lt="type-phase">phase</dfn>, which describes which <a>phase</a> the
      error occurred in:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><code>dns</code></dt>
        <dd>the error occurred during <a>DNS resolution</a></dd>

        <dt><code>connection</code></dt>
        <dd>
        the error occurred during <a>secure connection establishment</a>
        </dd>

        <dt><code>application</code></dt>
        <dd>
        the error occurred during the <a>transmission of request and
          response</a>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
      There are several predefined <a>network error</a> <a>types</a> defined in

      <h2>NEL policies</h2>

      <p>
      A <dfn data-lt="NEL policies">NEL policy</dfn> instructs a user agent
      whether to collect reports about <a>network requests</a> to an
      <a>origin</a>, and if so, where to send them.  <a>NEL policies</a> are
      delivered to the user agent via HTTP <a>response headers</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Each <a>NEL policy</a> has a <dfn>received IP address</dfn>, which is the
      IP address of the <a>server</a> that the user agent received this <a>NEL
        policy</a> from.
      </p>

      <p>
      Each <a>NEL policy</a> has an <dfn data-lt-nodefault data-lt="policy
        origin">origin</dfn>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Each <a>NEL policy</a> has a <dfn>subdomains</dfn> flag, which is either
      <code>include</code> or <code>exclude</code>.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
      Each <a>NEL policy</a> has a <dfn>reporting group</dfn>, which is the name
      of the Reporting <a>endpoint group</a> that reports for this policy will
      be sent to.
      </p>

      <p>
      Each <a>NEL policy</a> has a <dfn>ttl</dfn> representing the number of

      </p>

      <p>
      Each <a>NEL policy</a> has a <dfn>creation</dfn> which is the timestamp
      when the user agent received the policy.
      </p>

      <p>
      A <a>NEL policy</a> is <dfn>expired</dfn> if its <a>creation</a> plus its

      <h2>Sampling rates</h2>

      <p>
      An <a>origin</a> that expects to serve a large volume of traffic might not
      be equipped to ingest NEL reports for every <a>network request</a> made to
      the origin.  The origin can define <dfn data-lt="sampling rate">sampling
        rates</dfn> to limit the number of NEL reports that each user agent
      submits.  Since <a>successful</a> requests should typically greatly
      outnumber <a>failed</a> requests, the origin can specify different
      sampling rates for each.
      </p>

      <p>
      Each <a>NEL policy</a> has a <dfn>successful sampling rate</dfn>, which is
      a number between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive.
      </p>

      <p>
      Each <a>NEL policy</a> has a <dfn>failure sampling rate</dfn>, which is a

      A conformant user agent MUST provide a <dfn>policy cache</dfn>, which is a
      storage mechanism that maintains a set of <a>NEL policies</a>, keyed by
      their <a data-lt="policy origin">origins</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      This storage mechanism is opaque, vendor-specific, and not exposed to the
      web, but it MUST provide the following methods which will be used in the
      algorithms this document defines:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Insert, update, and delete <a>NEL policies</a>.</li>
        <li>Retrieve the <a>NEL policy</a>, if any, for an <a>origin</a>.</li>
        <li>Clear the cache.</li>

    <h2>Policy delivery</h2>

    <p>
    A <a>server</a> MAY define a <a>NEL policy</a> for an origin it controls via
    the <a>NEL</a> HTTP <a>response header</a>.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2><code>NEL</code> response header</h2>

      <p>
      The <dfn><code>NEL</code></dfn> <a>response header</a> is used to
      communicate an <a>origin</a>'s <a>NEL policy</a> to the user agent.  The
      ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) syntax for the <a>NEL</a> header is as
      follows:
      </p>

      <pre>NEL = json-field-value</pre>

      <p>
      The header's value is interpreted as an array of JSON objects, as defined
      by <a>json-field-value</a>. Each object in the array defines an <a>NEL
        policy</a> for the origin. The user agent MUST process the first valid
      policy in the array and ignore any additional policies in the array.
      </p>

      <p>User agents MUST ignore any unknown or invalid field(s) or value(s) that do not conform to the syntax defined in this specification. A valid <a>NEL</a> header field MUST, at a minimum, contain one object with all of the "REQUIRED" fields defined in this specification.</p>

      <p>The user agent MUST ignore the <a>NEL</a> header specified via a <code>meta</code> element to mitigate hijacking of error reporting via scripting attacks. The <a>NEL policy</a> MUST be delivered via the <a>NEL</a> <a>response header</a>.</p>

      <p class="note">The restriction on <code>meta</code> element is consistent with the [[CSP]] specification, which restricts reporting registration to HTTP header fields only for the same reasons.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>The <code>report_to</code> member</h2>

        <p>
        The <dfn><code>report_to</code></dfn> member specifies the <a>endpoint
          group</a> that reports for this <a>NEL policy</a> will be sent to.
        The <a>report_to</a> member is REQUIRED to register a <a>NEL policy</a>,
        and OPTIONAL if the intent is to remove a previous registration – see
        <a>max_age</a>.  If present, its value MUST be a string; any other type
        will result in a parse error.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
        To improve delivery of NEL reports, the <a>server</a> should set
        <code>report_to</code> to an <a>endpoint group</a> containing at least
        one endpoint in an alternative origin whose infrastructure is not
        coupled with the origin from which the resource is being fetched &mdash;
        otherwise network errors cannot be reported until the problem is solved,
        if ever &mdash; and provide multiple endpoints to provide alternatives
        if some endpoints are unreachable.

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The <code>max_age</code> member</h2>

        <p>
        The REQUIRED <dfn><code>max_age</code></dfn> member specifies the
        lifetime of this <a>NEL policy</a>, as a non-negative integer number of
        seconds.  Its value MUST be an non-negative integer; any other type will
        result in a parse error.
        </p>

        <p>
        A value of <code>0</code> will cause any <a>NEL policy</a> for this
        <a>origin</a> to be removed from the <a>policy cache</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
        To ensure delivery of NEL reports, the <a>server</a> should ensure that
        the Reporting <a>endpoint group</a> is also configured with a
        sufficiently high <code>max_age</code>.  If the Reporting policy
        expires, NEL reports will not be delivered, even if the NEL policy has
        not expired.

        <h2>The <code>include_subdomains</code> member</h2>

        <p>
        The OPTIONAL <dfn><code>include_subdomains</code></dfn> member is a
        boolean that enables this <a>NEL policy</a> for all subdomains of this
        origin.  If no member named <code>include_subdomains</code> is present
        in the object, or its value is not <code>true</code>, the <a>NEL
        policy</a> will not be enabled for subdomains.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
        To ensure delivery of NEL reports for subdomains, the application should
        ensure that the Reporting <a>endpoint group</a> is also configured with
        <code>include_subdomains</code> enabled.  If the Reporting policy is
        not, and there is not a separate Reporting policy for a given subdomain,
        NEL reports for that subdomain will not be delivered, even if the NEL
        policy includes the subdomain.

      <p>
      There are several predefined <a>network error</a> <a>types</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      The user agent MAY extend this list with custom <a>network error</a>
      <a>types</a> — e.g. to accommodate new protocols, or more detailed error
      descriptions of existing ones.  When doing so, the user agent SHOULD
      follow the dot-delimited pattern
      (<code>[group].[optional-subgroup].[error-name]</code>) for the
      <a>type</a> names to facilitate simple and consistent processing of the
      error reports — e.g. the collector may provide aggregation by category
      and/or one or multiple subgroups.

        the user agent received a <a>200 response</a> from the server via the
        HTTP/2 (<code>h2</code>) protocol, it encountered a protocol error in
        the exchange and was forced to abandon the navigation.  The user agent
        aborted the navigation 823 milliseconds after it started.  Finally, the
        user agent sent this report immediately after the network error was
        encountered – i.e. the report age is 0.

        <h2>Origins with multiple IP addresses</h2>

        <p>
        For <a>origins</a> whose <a>domain name</a> resolves to multiple IP
        addresses, NEL will sometimes "downgrade" an error report, providing
        less information about the cause of the error, since it cannot verify
        that the owner of the <a>origin</a> is the same as the owner of the
        <a>server</a> handling the <a>request</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        As an example, assume that <code>example.com</code> is handled by three
        <a>servers</a>, each with a different IP address.  The owner of the
        service configures DNS to resolve <code>example.com</code> to
        <code>192.168.0.1</code>, <code>192.168.0.2</code>, and
        <code>192.168.0.3</code>, and relies on user agents to balance their
        requests across these three IP addresses.  The service owner delivers
        the following <a>NEL policy</a>:
        </p>

        <pre class="example">
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1

        </pre>

        <p>
        Given the above, consider the following sequence of events:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
            The user agent sends a <a>request</a> to <code>192.168.0.1</code>,
            and receives a successful <a>response</a> from the <a>server</a>.
            This response includes the above <a>NEL policy</a>, and the user
            agent sets the policy's <a>received IP address</a> to
            <code>192.168.0.1</code>.  Since the <a>received IP address</a>
            matches the <a>server</a>'s IP address (which it must for any
            successful request), it generates the following NEL report:

            generate a <code>tcp.timed_out</code> report about the <a>failed</a>

            address that this <a>request</a> was sent to, the user agent cannot
            verify that the server at <code>192.168.0.3</code> is actually owned
            by the owners of <code>example.com</code>.  The user agent must

      <h2>Use cases</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Reporting of Navigation Failures</h2>

        <p>A navigation request initiated by the user (e.g. via a click on a link, direct input via the location bar, script-initiated due to user interaction, etc.) may fail due any number of connectivity reasons: DNS failure, TCP error, TLS protocol violation, and so on. These errors may be caused by network misconfiguration, transient routing issues, server downtime, malware or other attacks against the user, etc.</p>

        <p>In such cases the destination host is often left unaware of the failed navigation since, by definition, it cannot see the request reach its infrastructure and it is unable to investigate the problem. To address this, the host can register an <a>NEL policy</a> with the user agent, which specifies where reports of such failures should be delivered such that they can be investigated.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Reporting of First-party Subresource Fetch Failures</h2>

        <p>A typical application requires dozens of resources, the fetching of which is typically initiated via HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. The application requesting such resources can observe failures of most such fetches (e.g. via `onerror` callbacks), but it does not have access to the detailed network error report of why the failure has occurred - e.g. DNS failure, TCP error, TLS protocol violation, etc.</p>

        <p>To address this, the application can register relevant <a>NEL policies</a> with the user agent for the first-party hosts from which the subresources are being fetched. Then, if such a policy is present and a network error is encountered for a resource from an <a>origin</a> with a registered <a>NEL policy</a>, the user agent will report the detailed network error report and enable the application developers to investigate the error.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Reporting of Third-party Subresource Fetch Failures</h2>

        <p>In the case where a resource is embedded by a third party, the provider of the resource is often unable to instrument and observe the failure. For example, if `example.com` embeds a `widget.com/thing.js` resource on its site, and the user visiting `example.com` fails to fetch such resource due to a network error, the `widget.com` host is both unaware of the failure and unable to detect it.</p>

        <p>To address this, `widget.com` can register an NEL policy for its host. Then, if such policy is present and a network error is encountered while fetching a resource &mdash; regardless of whether it is being requested from a first-party or third-party origin &mdash; from the <a>origin</a> with a registered <a>NEL policy</a>, the user agent will report the network error and enable the provider to investigate the error.</p>

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>
      NEL provides network error reports that could expose new information about
      the user's network configuration. For example, an attacker could abuse NEL
      reporting to probe the user's network configuration, or to scan for
      servers on the user's internal network. Also, similar to HSTS, HPKP, and
      pinned CSP policies, the stored <a>NEL policy</a> could be used as a
      "supercookie" by setting a distinct policy with a custom (per-user)
      reporting URI to act as an identififer in combination with (or instead of)
      HTTP cookies.
      </p>

      <p>
      To mitigate some of the above risks, NEL registration is restricted to
      <a>trustworthy origins</a>, and delivery of network error reports is
      similarly restricted to <a>trustworthy origins</a>. This disallows a
      transient HTTP MITM from trivially abusing NEL as a persistent
      tracker.
      </p>

      <p>
      NEL is intended to augment existing server-side monitoring.  NEL reports
      should only be sent to the owner of the service being requested.  For
      errors that occur during <a>DNS resolution</a>, NEL reports are only
      generated when the <a>NEL policy</a> was received from the owner of the
      <a>domain namespace tree</a> that contains the <a>policy origin</a>.  For
      errors that occur during <a>secure connection establishment</a> or
      <a>transmission of request and response</a>, NEL reports are only
      generated when the <a>NEL policy</a> was received from the owner of the
      <a>server</a> that the <a>request</a> was sent to.
      </p>

      <p>
      This rationale explains the treatment of the <a>received IP address</a>
      and <a>subdomains</a> flag of a <a>NEL policy</a>.  By checking that the
      policy's <a>received IP address</a> matches the IP address of the
      <a>server</a>, NEL extends the trust boundary of the policy to include not
      just the policy's <a data-lt="policy origin">origin</a>, but also the
      specific server that the user agent is communicating with.  This helps
      prevent (for instance) DNS rebinding attacks, where an attacker delivers a
      long-lived <a>NEL policy</a> from a server that they own, and then changes
      their name servers to resolve the <a>policy origin</a> to a server they
      don't control.  Without the <a>received IP address</a> verification, this
      would cause user agents to send reports about the second server to the
      attacker.
      </p>

      <p>
      Similarly, <a data-lt="subdomains">subdomain</a> <a>NEL policies</a> are
      limited, and can only be used to generate reports about subdomains of the
      <a>policy origin</a> during the <a>DNS resolution</a> phase of a
      <a>request</a>.  During this phase, there is no <a>server</a> to verify
      ownership of, and the fact that the policy was received from a superdomain
      of the <a>request</a>'s <a>origin</a> is enough to establish ownership of
      the error.  This allows the owners of a particular portion of the
      <a>domain namespace tree</a> to use NEL to detect <a
        href="#dns-misconfiguration"></a> errors, while preventing them from
      using malicious DNS entries to collect information about servers they
      don't control.
      </p>

      <p>
      To prevent information leakage, NEL reports about a <a>request</a> do not
      contain any information that is not visible to the <a>server</a> when
      processing the <a>request</a>.  For errors during <a>DNS resolution</a>, a
      NEL report only contains information available from DNS itself.  This
      prevents <a>servers</a> from abusing NEL to collect more information about
      their users than they already have access to.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
      As an example, NEL reports specifically do not contain any information
      about which DNS <a>resolver</a> was used to resolve a <a>request</a>'s
      <a>domain name</a> into an IP address.
      </p>

      <p>In addition to above restrictions, the user agents MUST:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Clear the stored NEL policies when the user clears their browsing data (cookies, site data, history, etc).</li>
        <li>Refuse to process Set-Cookie response headers when delivering network error reports.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When deploying NEL the developer SHOULD consider privacy implications of NEL reports delivered to the specified collectors. For example, reports may contain URLs with sensitive data (e.g. "Capability URLs") that may need special precautions (see [[!CAPABILITY-URLS]]), and may require the developer to operate their own NEL collectors to prevent reporting of such URLs to third parties.</p>
