    <p>This document defines a mechanism that enables developers to declare a network error reporting policy for a web application. A user agent can use this policy to report encountered network errors that prevented it from successfully fetching requested resources.</p>
  </section>

  <section id='sotd'>
  <p>This is a <strong>proposal</strong> and may change without any notices. Interested parties should bring discussions to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Accurately measuring performance characteristics of web applications is an important aspect in helping site developers understand how to improve their web applications. The worst case scenario is the failure to load the application, or a particular resource, due to a network error, and to address such failures the developer requires assistance from the user agent to identify when, where, and why such failures are occurring.</p>

    <p>Today, application developers do not have real-time web application availability data from their end users. For example, if the user fails to load the page due to a network error, such as a failed DNS lookup, a connection timeout, a reset connection, or other reasons, the site developer is unable to detect and address this issue. Existing methods, such as synthetic monitoring provide a partial solution by placing monitoring nodes in predetermined geographic locations, but require additional infrastructure investments, and cannot provide truly global and near real-time availability data for real end users.</p>

    <p>Network Error Logging (<dfn>NEL</dfn>) addresses this need by defining a mechanism enabling web applications to declare a reporting policy that can be used by the user agent to report network errors for a given origin. To take advantage of <a>NEL</a>, a web application opts into using <a>NEL</a> by supplying a <code>NEL</code> HTTP response header field that describes the reporting policy. Then, if the <a>NEL</a> policy is available for a given origin, and an end user fails to successfully fetch a resource from that origin, the user agent logs the network error report and attempts to deliver it to a group of endpoints previously configured using the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/reporting/">Reporting API</a>.</p>

    <p>For example, if the user agent fails to fetch a resource from <code>https://www.example.com</code> due to an aborted TCP connection, the user agent would queue the following report via the Reporting API:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>type</dt>
      <dd><code>"network-error"</code></dd>
      <dt>endpoint group</dt>
      <dd>the endpoint group configured by <a href="#the-report-to-field">the <code>report-to</code> field</a></dd>
      <dt>settings</dt>
      <dd>TODO</dd>
      <dt>data</dt>
      <dd><pre class="highlight">
{
  "uri": "https://www.example.com/resource",
  "referrer": "https://referrer.com/",
  "server-ip": "123.122.121.120",
  "elapsed-time": 321,
  "type": "tcp.aborted"
}
      </pre></dd>
    </dl>

    <section>
      <h2>Policy Delivery and Processing</h2>
      <p>The server delivers the <a>NEL policy</a> to the user agent via an HTTP response header field (<a>NEL header field</a>). If the result of executing <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/#is-origin-trustworthy">is-origin-trustworthy</a> algorithm [[!SECURE-CONTEXTS]] on the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2">origin</a> that served the <a>NEL policy</a> is <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code> then the user agent MUST either:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Register the host as a <a>known NEL origin</a> if it is not already registered.</li>
        <li>Update the registered policy for the <a>known NEL origin</a> if the provided policy is different than that already stored by the user agent.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Otherwise, if the result of the algorithm is <strong>not</strong> <code>Potentionally Trustworthy</code>, then the user MUST ignore the provided <a>NEL policy</a>.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>`NEL` Header Field</h2>
        <p>The <dfn>NEL header field</dfn> is used to communicate the <dfn>NEL policy</dfn> to the user agent. The ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) syntax for the <a>NEL header field</a> is as follows:</p>

        <pre>
NEL = <a>json-field-value</a>
        </pre>

        <p>The header's value is interpreted as an array of JSON objects, as
        described in Section 4 of [[HTTP-JFV]].</p>

        <p>Each object in the array defines an <a>NEL policy</a> for the origin.
        The user agent MUST process the first valid policy in the array.</p>

        <p>User agents MUST ignore any unknown or invalid field(s) or value(s) that do not conform to the syntax defined in this specification. A valid <a>NEL header field</a> MUST, at a minimum, contain one object with all of the "REQUIRED" fields defined in this specification.</p>

        <p>The user agent MUST ignore the NEL header specified via a <code>meta</code> element to mitigate hijacking of error reporting via scripting attacks. The <a>NEL policy</a> MUST be delivered via the <a>NEL header field</a>.</p>

        <p class="note">The restriction on <code>meta</code> element is consistent with [[CSP]] specification, which restricts reporting registration to HTTP header fields only for same reasons.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>The `report-to` Field</h2>
          <p>The <dfn>report-to</dfn> field specifies the <a>endpoint group</a> to which the user agent sends reports about network errors. The <a>report-to</a> field is a REQUIRED field to register an <a>NEL policy</a>, and OPTIONAL if the intent is to remove a previous registration - see <a>max-age</a>. The value of the field MUST be a string containing the <a>endpoint group</a> to which reports will be sent.</p>

          <p class="note">To improve delivery of NEL reports, the application should set `report-to` to an endpoint group containing at least one endpoint in an alternative origin whose infrastructure is not coupled with the origin from which the resource is being fetched &mdash; otherwise network errors cannot be reported until the problem is solved, if ever &mdash; and provide multiple endpoints to provide alternatives if some endpoints are unreachable.</p>

        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>The `max-age` Field</h2>
          <p>The REQUIRED <dfn>max-age</dfn> field specifies the number of seconds, after the reception of the NEL header field, during which the user agent regards the host (from whom the policy was received) as a <a>known NEL origin</a>. The value of the field MUST be an non-negative integer.</p>

          <p>A <a>max-age</a> value of zero (i.e. '"max-age": 0') signals the user agent to cease regarding the host as a <a>known NEL origin</a>, including the <a>includeSubDomains</a> field if provided.</p>

          <p class="note">To ensure delivery of NEL reports, the application should ensure that the Reporting API is also configured with a sufficiently high max-age. If the Reporting policy expires, NEL reports will not be delivered, even if the NEL policy has not expired.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>The `includeSubDomains` Field</h2>
          <p>The OPTIONAL <dfn>includeSubDomains</dfn> field, if present and true, signals the user agent that the <a>NEL policy</a> applies not only to the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2">origin</a> that served the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3">resource representation</a>, but also to any <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2">origin</a> whose <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-host">host</a> component is a subdomain of the <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-host">host</a> component of the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3">resource representation</a>’s <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2">origin</a>. If present, the value of the field MUST be a boolean value.</p>

          <p class="note">To ensure delivery of NEL reports for subdomains, the application should ensure that the Reporting API is also configured with includeSubdomains enabled. If the Reporting policy is not, and there is not a separate Reporting policy for a given subdomain, NEL reports for that subdomain will not be delivered, even if the NEL policy includes the subdomain.</p>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Policy Storage and Maintenance</h2>

      <p>An HTTP host declares itself an <dfn>NEL origin</dfn> by issuing an <a>NEL policy</a>, which is communicated via the <a>NEL header field</a> from a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/#is-origin-trustworthy">potentially trustworthy origin</a>. Upon error-free receipt and processing of this header by a conformant user agent, the user agent regards the host as a <dfn>known NEL origin</dfn>.</p>

      <p>The user agent MUST maintain the <a>NEL policy</a> of any given <a>NEL origin</a> separately from any NEL policies issued by any other <a data-lt="NEL origin">NEL origins</a>. Only the given <a>NEL origin</a> can update or cause deletion of its <a>NEL policy</a>. This is accomplished by sending a <a>NEL header field</a> to the user agent with new values for the policy <a data-lt="report-to">endpoint group</a>, <a data-lt="max-age">time duration</a>, and <a data-lt="includeSubDomains">subdomain applicability</a>. Thus, the user agent MUST store the "freshest" <a>NEL policy</a> information on behalf of an <a>NEL origin</a>, and specifying a zero time duration MUST cause the user agent to delete the <a>NEL policy</a> (including any asserted <a>includeSubDomains</a> field) for that <a>NEL origin</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reporting</h2>

      <p>A <dfn>network error</dfn> is any condition where a connection or a  protocol error is encountered by the user agent, thus preventing it from successfully completing the request-response exchange. This may include, but is not limited to DNS, TCP, TLS, and HTTP connection and protocol errors. For example, a <a>network error</a> is triggered when the user agent:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fails to resolve the DNS name</li>
        <li>Fails to establish a TCP connection</li>
        <li>Fails to establish a secure TLS tunnel</li>
        <li>Fails to fetch the resource due to a TLS protocol error</li>
        <li>Fails to fetch the resource due to a HTTP protocol error</li>
        <li>Fails to fetch the resource due to a socket timeout or error</li>
        <li>Fails to fetch the resource due to a redirect loop</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The user agent MAY classify and report server error responses (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6">5xx status code</a>, [[RFC7231]]) as network errors. For example, a network error report may be triggered when a fetch fails due to proxy or gateway errors, service downtime, and other types of server errors.</p>

      <p>The failure to fetch a resource when the user agent is known to be offline (when <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#navigator.online">`navigator.onLine`</a> returns `false`) MUST NOT be considered to be a <a>network error</a>.</p>

      <p class="note">Note that the above definition of "network error" is different from definition in [[Fetch]]. The definition of <a>network error</a> in this specification is a subset of [[Fetch]] definition - i.e. all of the above conditions would trigger a "network error" in [[Fetch]] processing, but conditions such as blocked requests due to mixed content, CORS failures, etc., would not.</p>

      <p>When a <a>network error</a> occurs for a URL that belongs to a <a>known NEL origin</a> the user agent SHOULD log the error and queue it for delivery to the <a data-lt="report-to">endpoint group</a> defined by the <a>NEL policy</a> of the associated <a>NEL origin</a>.</p>

      <p>Delivery of reports, including scheduling, retrying, or abandoning delivery, is handled by the Reporting API, not by Network Error Logging.</p>

      <p>To generate a <dfn>network error object</dfn>, the user agent MUST use an algorithm equivalent to the following:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Prepare a JSON object <em>neterror</em> with the following keys and values:

        <h2>Sample Network Error Reports</h2>

        <p>This section contains an example network error report the user agent might queue when a network error is encountered for a <a>known NEL origin</a>.</p>

        <pre class="example">
{
        "nel-report": [
            {
              "uri": "https://www.example.com/",
              "referrer": "http://example.com/",
              "server-ip": "123.122.121.120",
              "protocol": "h2",
              "status-code": 200,
              "elapsed-time": 823,
              "age": 0,
              "type": "http.protocol.error"
            }
          ]
        }
        </pre>

        <p>The above report indicates that the user agent attempted to navigate from "example.com" to "www.example.com" (<a>known NEL origin</a>), which successfully resolved to the "123.122.121.120" IP address. However, while the user agent received a "200" response from the server via the "h2" protocol, it encountered a protocol error in the exchange and was forced to abandon the navigation. 823 milliseconds elapsed between the start of navigation and when the user agent aborted the navigation. Finally, the user agent sent this report immediately after the network error was encountered - i.e. the report age is 0.</p>

        <pre class="example">
{
        "nel-report": [
            {
              "uri": "https://widget.com/thing.js",
              "referrer": "https://www.example.com/",
              "server-ip": "234.233.232.231",
              "protocol": "",
              "status-code": 0,
              "elapsed-time": 143,
              "age": 0,
              "type": "http.dns.name_not_resolved"
            }
          ]
        }
        </pre>

        <p>The above report indicates that the user agent attempted to fetch  "https://widget.com/thing.js", which belongs to a previously registered <a>NEL origin</a>, from "www.example.com" origin. However, the user agent was unable to resolve the DNS name and the request was aborted by the user agent after 143 milliseconds. Because "widget.com" is a known NEL origin, a network error report was logged and sent to the report URL specified by the NEL policy of that host immediately after the network error was encountered - i.e. the report age is 0.</p>

      <h2>Use cases</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Reporting of Navigation Failures</h2>

        <p>A navigation request initiated by the user (e.g. via a click on a link, direct input via the location bar, script-initiated due to user interaction, etc.) may fail due any number of connectivity reasons: DNS failure, TCP error, TLS protocol violation, and so on. These errors may be caused by network misconfiguration, transient routing issues, server downtime, malware or other attacks against the user, etc.</p>

        <p>In such cases the destination host is often left unaware of the failed navigation since, by definition, it cannot see the request reach its infrastructure and it is unable to investigate the problem. To address this, the host can register an <a>NEL policy</a> with the user agent, which specifies where reports of such failures should be delivered such that they can be investigated.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Reporting of First-party Subresource Fetch Failures</h2>

        <p>A typical application requires dozens of resources, the fetching of which is typically initiated via HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. The application requesting such resources can observe failures of most such fetches (e.g. via `onerror` callbacks), but it does not have access to the detailed network error report of why the failure has occurred - e.g. DNS failure, TCP error, TLS protocol violation, etc.</p>

        <p>To address this, the application can register relevant NEL policies with the user agent for the first-party hosts from which the subresources are being fetched. Then, if such a policy is present and a network error is encountered for a resource associated with a registered <a>NEL origin</a>, the user agent will report the detailed network error report and enable the application developers to investigate the error.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Reporting of Third-party Subresource Fetch Failures</h2>

        <p>In the case where a resource is embedded by a third party, the provider of the resource is often unable to instrument and observe the failure. For example, if `example.com` embeds a `widget.com/thing.js` resource on its site, and the user visiting `example.com` fails to fetch such resource due to a network error, the `widget.com` host is both unaware of the failure and unable to detect it.</p>

        <p>To address this, `widget.com` can register an NEL policy for its host. Then, if such policy is present and a network error is encountered while fetching a resource &mdash; regardless of whether it is being requested from a first-party or third-party origin &mdash; from the registered <a>NEL origin</a>, the user agent will report the network error and enable the provider to investigate the error.</p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p><a>NEL</a> provides network error reports that could expose new information about the user's network configuration. For example, an attacker could abuse NEL reporting to probe users network configuration. Also, similar to HSTS, HPKP, and pinned CSP policies, the stored <a>NEL policy</a> could be used as a "supercookie" by setting a distinct policy with a custom (per-user) reporting URI to act as an identififer in combination with (or instead of) HTTP cookies.</p>

      <p>To mitigate some of the above risks, NEL registration is restricted to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/#is-origin-trustworthy">trustworthy origins</a>, and delivery of network error reports is similarly restricted to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/#is-origin-trustworthy">trustworthy origins</a>. This disallows a transient HTTP MITM from trivially abusing NEL as a persistent tracker.</p>

      <p>In addition to above restrictions, the user agents MUST:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Clear the stored NEL policies when the user clears their browsing data (cookies, site data, history, etc).</li>
        <li>Refuse to process Set-Cookie response headers when delivering network error reports.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When deploying NEL the developer SHOULD consider privacy implications of NEL reports delivered to the specified collectors. For example, reports may contain URLs with sensitive data (e.g. "Capability URLs") that may need special precautions (see [[!CAPABILITY-URLS]]), and may require the developer to operate their own NEL collectors to prevent reporting of such URLs to third parties.</p>
